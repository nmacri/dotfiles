# nmacri's (previously Mathias’s) dotfiles

## Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmacri/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```


When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
./.macos
```


### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
